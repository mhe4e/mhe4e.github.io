                <h4>Website</h4>
                <p>We appreciate everyone's alerts about the events section of the website, as well as other concerns. As you can imagine, there is some complex coding for the site to work seamlessly with SalesForce and we have had to deal with a few glitches. All urgent matters should be sent to <a href="mailto:digital@e4e.org"><b>digital@e4e.org.</b></a></p>

                <h6><em>What's been fixed:</em></h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>• Events are now filtered to only show those marked “Display on Website” in Salesforce.</li>
                    <li>• All events are now registering users for the correct event. (There were a few events that were logging registrations for other events.)</li>
                    <li>• For events that do not require membership to attend, non-members are now passed to a shorter page (<a href="https://e4e.org/take-action/attend-event/register-event" target="_blank"><b>viewable here</b></a>) instead of being directed to the Declaration.</li>
                    <li>• Events are now showing the correct start and end dates and times.</li>
                    <li>• The correct event links are showing up in Salesforce; these are viewable in the External Event URL field (the same place where links showed up before).</li>
                    <li>• We developed a process to ensure the most recent content (ie the week's TTB) will be showcased.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="row indent">
                <h6><em>What's in the works:</em></h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>• For some users, the Declaration is not directing them to the thank you page after they click “Sign the Declaration." This is a high priority item, but the good news is the website is accurately logging online signups and no data is being lost.</li>
                    <li>• On some events, the “Add to Calendar” button is not appearing.</li>
                    <li>• A number of format corrections are being made throughout the site.</li>
                    <li>• A few site enhancements are also being made from now through the end of March. We are still finalizing this list.</li>

                <h6><em>How you can help with event content:</em><br>
                    You’ll want to pay attention to these three fields when creating events in Salesforce:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Display on Website: Check this field if the event should be shown on the main list of events or your chapter’s list of events. If left uncheck, you’ll still be able to share a link, but it won’t appear on the website.</li>
                    <li>2. Event List Description: Use this to provide the brief event description is listed on the website. (Think 140 characters or less, and avoid repeating the event name.)</li>
                    <li>3. Description: Here’s where you’ll write the summary of the event that is displayed in detail on the website, otherwise the page is blank.</li>

                    <li>• <span class="highlight">PowerPoint template:</span> The template has all the slide formats and it is not just the title page. To access the other slide formats, click on "Add a New Slide" and you will see the other format options. There were a few items that need to be tweaked and we have updated the file this weekend.</li>
                    <li>• <span class="highlight">Logo Files:</span> There was a report that the download of the logo files don't work. We are unable to replicate this issue and need more details. For most cases, you will want to download the png file. There is a file in full color (green and black), 1 color (all black) and reversed out (all white).</li>
                    <li>• <span class="highlight">Fonts:</span> If you are having difficulty with installing Roboto, please contact Josh Garlenski or Michael Holloway. The process for the install depends on your computer setup.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>• A great question was raised on why we say grassroots organizing when we said grassroots in hate-bait in the brand discovery. To clarify, the brand discovery was specifically about how we describe E4E as an organization. "E4E is a teacher-led organization" is stronger than saying "E4E is a grassroots organization." When it comes to our work, we do build a movement through grassroots organizing. We apologize for this confusion.</li>
                    <li>• There was a request for a talking point for the "collaborating with all stakeholders, including students and families as well as labor, civil rights, civic, and community-based organizations to find solutions." We are working on adding this.</li>
                    <li>• Lastly, there was a question on why was "Contractual Change" was removed from the TOC? This was actually removed in earlier versions of the TOC and instead of adding more words, we believe we are still acknowledging contractual changes by saying "Change policy at the District level."</li>
